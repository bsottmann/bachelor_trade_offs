# bachelor_trade_offs_&_synergies
This code is part of the bachelor thesis "Analysis of trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services interactions: A case study on wetland drainage in the Canadian prairies" as part of a STEER case study. This code merges the input and impact matrices to one trade-off and synergy matrix.

The input and output matrices need to be ordered and named like the ones in the 'code_text' excel document. 
The code pulls in the 'input' and 'impact' sheets and merges them into one trade-off and synergy matrix that is then saved into a new excel file in the workspace. If questions arise, please feel free to ask.
