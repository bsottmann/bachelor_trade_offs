# bachelor_trade_offs_&_synergies
This code is part of the bachelor thesis "Analysis of trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services interactions: A case study on wetland drainage in the Canadian prairies" as part of a STEER case study. This code merges the input and impact matrices to one trade-off and synergy matrix.

The code is mostly hard-coded and thus probably needs some adjustments in other scenarios. Especially the file and sheet names need to be adjusted if this code should be used on other code.

The input and output matrices need to be ordered and named like the ones in the 'code_text' excel document. 
The code pulls in the 'input' and 'impact' sheets and merges them into one trade-off and synergy matrix that is then saved into a new excel file in the workspace. If questions arise, please feel free to ask.
